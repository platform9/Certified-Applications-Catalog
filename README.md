# Existing Application Catalog with hundreds of pre-built Kubernetes applications 

![screen_applications-catalog2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34694236/62586046-a6745300-b870-11e9-8add-03dca2576e9a.png)

## So what are we changing?: The Platform0 Opensource Certified Application Catlog 

While there are many pre-packaged Helm chart available, developers want the ability to deploy custom applications leveraging their own Helm charts and value. This also must happen alongside custom application templates and be vetted by automations teams  

With Platform9's new "certified" applications catalog, the goal will be just this: to easily add additional custom templates either as Helm charts, YAML files, or Operators, and pre-package them in a way that is easy to deliver for operations, and simple to consume for developers 

These charts will be curated and continously maintained and operated by Platfrom9 engineering and SRE experts. Users will also have the choice to commit their own helm charts to the repo and the standard of excellence we are seeking to open up to the entire opensource community.
