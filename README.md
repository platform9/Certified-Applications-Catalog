Existing Application Catalog with hundreds of pre-built Kubernetes applications 

![screen_applications-catalog2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34694236/62586046-a6745300-b870-11e9-8add-03dca2576e9a.png)

## Coming Soon: A Platform Certified Application Catalog for everyone 

While there are many pre-packaged Helm charts available in the community today, developers want the ability to deploy custom applications leveraging their own Helm charts and values in multiple contexts and kubernetes infrastructures. This also must happen alongside custom application templates and be vetted by automations teams. With these complexities comes the next challenge of how to package applications into docker images, scan them for security constraints, productize them, and ship them via Helm or Operators via CICD. 

As experts in managed Kubernetes and SaaS, we are now spearheading a grass-roots movement to make "bring your app" a possibility; and we want to do so with out sacrificing quality or security. This means that these charts will be curated continously by our team of solutions experts who are working with kubernetes teams every day in the field. 

Platform9's new "certified" applications catalog:

* Easily adds additional custom templates either as Helm charts, YAML files, or Operators

* Pre-packages them in a way that is easy to deliver for operations, and simple to consume for developers

* Is free to use on your Kubernetes cluster even if you're not a Platform9 customer. 

* Allows you to commit your own helm charts to the repo, adding to the standard of excellence

* Bring the benefitw of Helm, along with the new wave of "bring your own operator", into Kubernetes 1.14 and beyond
